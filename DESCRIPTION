Description: A self-contained R package for generating barcode sheets for nanopore sequencing. 
    Includes built-in lookup tables for REV and FW barcode sequences, making it easy 
    for collaborators to generate barcode sheets with minimal setup. Users only need 
    to provide their sample sheet with SampleID, FW-X, and REV-X columns.
